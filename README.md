# InventoryApp – Phase 1

## Summary
This is the first phase of my C++ capstone project. I created a class named `Item` to represent a single inventory item. It has a name and quantity, with full getter/setter support and overloaded operators for comparison and output.

## Files
- `Item.h` – Class definition
- `Item.cpp` – Class implementation
- `main.cpp` – Test driver

## Resources Used
- ChatGPT (for planning structure and debugging tips)
- cplusplus.com for syntax reference
- Instructor lectures and Canvas materials

## Notes
The part that went well was writing the class and testing in main. The only challenge was deciding which operators to overload at first.
